# CercaLabs Project

Note: I could have separated components and passed props, but decided not to because this is a tiny app. I also could have used Redux and actions instead of making the HTTP requests within the class, but, again, it was a small app, so I decided not to do that.

## How to Start Application

1. Install Node v10.2.1
2. Clone repo
3. cd into cercaLabsProj dir
4. Type npm i
5. Once node modules are installed, type npm run dev
6. Ensure no errors
7. App is hosted on port 3005
8. Enjoy!!
